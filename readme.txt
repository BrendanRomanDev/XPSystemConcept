/// HOW IT WORKS ///

Log Hours And Minutes in the top two boxes. Time will get converted to XP, and the UI will reflect user progresss.

Ignore the 2 bottom Input Boxes - these are for testing Max Hours Allowed, and A Level-Cap respectively.
"400" indicates 400 hours to reach max level.
"100" indicates the max level, which will be 100.
