This is a concept/test application made to assist in developing the Experience Point Generation algorithm and UI Animations involved in my React JS habit tracking application.

## HOW IT WORKS

Log Hours And Minutes in the top two boxes. Time will get converted to XP, and the UI will reflect user level and progress stats.

You can Ignore the 2 bottom Input Boxes - these are for testing Max Hours Allowed, and A Level-Cap respectively.
"400" indicates 400 hours to reach max level.
"100" indicates the max level, which will be 100.
